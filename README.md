# Huntopia

Huntopia is a campus exploration app that encourages students and visitors to discover university buildings by scanning QR codes to unlock achievement badges. It turns orientation into a lightweight, gamified experience while tracking progress across all locations.

## Problem
New and current students often do not explore campus fully, and traditional orientation can feel passive. There is a need for a more interactive and motivating way to discover buildings.

## Solution
Users scan QR codes at campus buildings to claim badges in the app. The app tracks unlocked buildings and overall progress (e.g., 3/15), making exploration visible and rewarding.

## Target Users
- New and current AU students
- Campus visitors

## Core Features
- Preloaded building list with badge icons
- QR scanner (camera)
- Claim achievement after a scan

## Benefits

- Simple way to track visited locations
